    <h2>Good Old Fashioned Pancakes</h2>
      <p>A pancake is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter. It is a type of batter bread.</p>
      <p>This easy recipe makes pancakes that are light and fluffy. You only need a few simple ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen right now.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>195g all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Make the batter</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and the salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Warm milk in the microwave or on top of the stove until lukewarm, not hot. You should be able to keep your finger submerged for 10 seconds.</li>
                <li>Whisk milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until combined. (By warming the milk slightly, the melted butter mixes into the milk instead of turning into small lumps).</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Cook the Pancakes</h3>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Heat a large skillet (or use griddle) over medium heat. The pan is ready if when you splatter a little water onto the pan surface, the water dances around the pan and eventually evaporates.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, pour milk mixture into the well and use a fork to stir until you no longer see clumps of flour. It is okay if the batter has small lumps - it is important not to over-mix the batter.</li>
                <li>Lightly brush skillet with melted butter (this is optional if you have a high-quality non-stick pan). Use a 1/4-cup measuring cup to spoon batter onto the skillet. Gently spread the batter into a 4-inch circle.</li>
                <li>When edges look dry, and bubbles start to appear and pop on the top surfaces of the pancake, turn over. This takes about 2 minutes. Once flipped, cook another 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned and cooked in the middle. Serve immediately with warm syrup, butter, and berries.</li>
            </ol>
