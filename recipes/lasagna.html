        <h2>The History of Lasagna</h2>

          <p>The dish we call lasagna has been called, for most of its existence, and in most parts of the world, lasagne. 
            Lasagna is singular, and lasagne is plural. The exact etymology of the word is unclear, but it has referred to a wide sheet of pasta that
            is placed in a pot with food served on top of it for a very long time.  The first reference to it in the Oxford English Dictionary is from 
            the 18th Century, and that's just to its appearance in print in English. There are references to words very similar to lasagne in Greek and
             Latin, as a scholarly article describes here. 
          </p>
        
          <p> In Italy, there is no one way to make lasagne. It is a dish that varies by region, with the only constant being the noodles. Some versions
             have a lot of meat; some have fruit, some have eggs, some have cheese. Besides the noodles, the common factor is that lasagne is a dish usually 
             reserved for special occasions.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 lbs beef mince</li>
            <li>1/2 minced onion</li> 
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans tomato</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>Bechamel sauce to taste</li>
            <li>Cheese to taste</li>
          </ul>
        
          <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
